// Sam decides to do cycling 30 minutes everyday for 15 days.
//Cycling for 30 minutes burns 225 calories on average. 
//Use console.log to tell Sam how much calories he would lose:

//var1, calories lost per 30 minutes of cycling
let var1 = 225;

//var2, number of hours per cycling day
let var2 = 0.5;

//var3, number of calories burned per minute
let var3 = 7.5;

//var4, duration (in minutes) cycling workout
let var4 = 30;

//var5, number of days in a week
let var5 = 7;


//caloriesLost, total calories lost 
let caloriesLost = var3 * var4 * var5

//display result
console.log(`Great work, Sam! After ${var2} hours of cycling everyday for a week, you may lose a total of ${caloriesLost} calories.`);
