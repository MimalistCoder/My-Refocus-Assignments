// You are now working on a finance app that helps users save money. 
// To encourage users to continue saving, you are adding a feature 
// to show how much money they have already saved.
// Suppose that Sam wants to save ₱10,000 and has already 
// saved ₱7,500. Use console.log and variables to output the following in JavaScript:
// “Thank you for your discipline and hardwork, Sam! You are now 25% away from your goal of saving ₱10,000.”

// Assign goal, for future amount
let goal = 10000;

// Assign variable savemoney for principal amount
let savemoney = 7500;

//Use constant, 100 for percentage 
let constant = 100;

// Assign perncentageLeft, to calculate the percentage of the goal saved.
let perncentageLeft = (1-savemoney/goal)*constant;

//showing results...
console.log(`Thank you for your discipline and hardwork, Sam! 
You are now ${perncentageLeft}% from saving ₱${goal}.`);
//end
